1. in scatter plots, changed marker size to 10
2. in box plots, removed outliers and decreases the yMax from 1.05*yMax
   to yMax

1. line 441: added another list (radList) to keep track of the radius of the
   parent segments in ratio calculations
2. line 484: added radList to the properties dictionary
3. line 501: added unit 'um' to the units dictionary
4. line 344: forced median indexing to be int() in reponse to an error 
   -- This error only popped up when I migrated to python 3.4
5. line 340: same thing, forced medianInd = int(...)
6. line 459: added avg of daughter-parent ratios for each segment:
7. line 469: also added daughter-daughter radius
