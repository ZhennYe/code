Length constant:
 l = sqrt(0.5 * r * rho_m / rho_i)
   = sqrt(0.5 * r / (gLeak * rho_i))
   = 1000 * sqrt(0.5 * r_um / (gLeak_us_per_mm^2 * rho_i_MOhm_um))

Scaling:
  To keep resistance the same while changing R_Intra -> R_Intra * F_R
	D -> D * sqrt(Fact_R)
  To keep capacitance the same while changing C_Specific -> C_Specific * F_C
        Area -> Area / F_C
        Which means gBar->gBar * F_C, pBar->pBar * F_C

  D -> D * (f_R / F_C)^(1/3)
  L -> L * 1 / (f_R * F_C^2)^(1/3)
