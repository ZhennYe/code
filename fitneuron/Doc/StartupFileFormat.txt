# comments start with #
# information is passed to the main program on lines that start with a keyword
#   followed by values on the same line
# list of valid keywords:
#   time, geometry, record, clamp, fit, channel, parameter

# keyword "geometry"
  # provide the name of the file that contains the neuron geometry
  geometry fileName

# keyword "channeldir"
  #specify directory of channel model shared object files
  channelDir directory

# keyword "time"
  # set the maximum time step of the simulation or fit
  time dT tFinal

# keyword "record"
  # record target from specified compartment in intervals of dT (ms)
  record [v/i/i_channelName]_compartmentName dT

# keyword "clamp"
  # clamp target to match trace at specified compartment
  clamp [v/i/i_channelName]_compartmentName fileName traceNumber

# keyword "fit"
  # produce an error measurement by deviations from target at specified
  # compartment. Specify fitTau, a characteristic time to force the simulated
  # trace towards greater agreement with the fit trace
  fit [v/i/i_channelName]_compartmentName fileName traceNumber fitTau

# keyword "channel"
  # add channel to compartments specified by tagName.  Note that tagName can
  # be * or compartmentName
  channel channelName tagName

# keyword "parameter"
  # set parameter to value, do not fit
  parameter paramName value
  # set fit parameter, ranging between minVal and maxVal
  parameter paramName minVal maxVal
  # set fit parameter, ranging between minVal and maxVal, but with initial
  # population between startMin and startMax
  parameter paramName minVal maxVal startMin startMax
