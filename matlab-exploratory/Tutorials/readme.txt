Directions for installing the Computational Mathematics Tutorial files in MATLAB.

1) If not yet done, download the “computationalMath_tutorial.zip” file from the tutorial player Appendix, or the examples link under the subheading, Tutorial Appendix, on the main Computational Mathematics tutorial launch pad.

2) Once you have downloaded the ZIP-file, place it in the default MATLAB work directory, usually a directory called MATLAB under your root “Documents” directory of your machine.

3) Extract the example files from the ZIP-file into this directory. The ZIP-file will extract the files into a new subdirectory named, “computationalMath_tutorial”. 

4) Start MATLAB and change directory using the Change Directory Browser to the “computationalMath_tutorial” folder that you just extracted.

5) Once complete, you should see the files and folders in the tutorial directory in the Current Directory Browser of MATLAB.
